# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

- Development and refinement of core components: LED driver (src/led_driver.h), main application logic (src/main.cpp), and WiFi input source (src/wifi_input_source.h).
- Initializing the memory bank to establish comprehensive project documentation.

## Recent Changes

- No major code changes recorded; project is in active development with implemented features for LED effects, input handling, and web interface.
- Memory bank files (product.md, context.md) created as part of initialization.

## Next Steps

- Document system architecture and technology stack in memory bank.
- Verify memory bank accuracy with user feedback.
- Expand testing coverage and integrate hardware for full validation.
- Potential enhancements to web interface or effect modes.

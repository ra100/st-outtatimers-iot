# Outtatimers Implant

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Create the smallest possible coin-cell-powered circuit with blinking LED(s).

**Microcontroller**: ATTINY10 (SOT-23-6)

- Ultra-low-power design suitable for 1 √ó CR2032 (3V) battery
- Can drive one blue LED to blink and two white LEDs dimly or intermittently

## üîß Programming Setup

**Programmer**: USBasp with TPI-capable firmware
**Connection**: 5 pads required

- VCC
- GND
- TPICLK
- TPIDATA
- RESET

## üí° Blink Pattern Design

- Use ATTINY10 sleep and wake from WDT to pulse LEDs briefly
- Short pulses (5‚Äì10ms) at low duty cycle to maximize battery life
- Ultra-low power consumption for extended coin cell operation

- [x] Component selection and BOM created
- [x] Programming approach determined (USBasp + TPI)

## üöß Still Missing / Needed

### Full Schematic Design

- [ ] Battery connection circuit
- [ ] ATTINY10 VCC/GND connections
- [ ] Decoupling capacitor placement
- [ ] LED(s) + series resistors circuit
- [ ] Complete circuit diagram

### Hardware Implementation

- [ ] PCB layout or breadboard plan (optional, but useful for tiny assembly)
- [ ] Programming header / pads (5 small pads for USBasp TPI)
- [ ] Component placement optimization for minimal size

### Optional Extras

- [ ] Small switch to test LEDs without removing battery
- [ ] Test points for measuring voltage/current if debugging
- [ ] Tiny protection diode (optional, to prevent reverse battery insertion)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Design complete schematic** showing all components and connections
2. **Create PCB layout** optimized for minimal size
3. **Assemble prototype** with selected components
4. **Test programming** via USBasp TPI interface
5. **Verify power consumption** and battery life
6. **Optimize blink patterns** for maximum efficiency

## üîç Technical Notes

- **Power Management**: Focus on ultra-low power consumption
- **Size Optimization**: Minimize PCB footprint for coin cell applications
- **Programming**: TPI interface requires specific USBasp firmware
- **Timing**: Internal WDT oscillator - no external timing components needed
- **Simplified Design**: Uses ATTINY10's built-in timing capabilities for maximum compactness
